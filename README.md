# Alessandro Ponton's TypeScript and React Project - Fashion Quiz

## Technologies Used
- **React** for creating the user interface and managing components.
- **TypeScript** for adding static typing and making the code more robust and scalable.
- **CSS** for styling components and user interface.
- **Vite** for managing development dependencies.

## Main Features
- Multiple choice quiz with 5 questions about sustainable fashion.
- Half-second timer before moving to the next question after selecting an answer.
- Results screen with numerical score and fashion-world based classification.

## Commentary
As requested, I structured the quiz into three components:

- Initial screen
- Questions section with answer options
- Results screen

The initial screen explains the quiz topic and contains the start button.
The questions section contains 4 options for each question, I tried to make them as visually consistent as possible.
The results screen provides the total of correct answers along with a 'fashion world' evaluation that I decided to implement on my own initiative.
